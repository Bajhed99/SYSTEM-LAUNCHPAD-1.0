# SYSTEM Launchpad  
**Sovereign Agentic Intelligence OS for Business Conversations**

SYSTEM Launchpad is a **100% Canadian-sovereign, agentic intelligence platform** that transforms meetings into actionable, predictive business intelligence.  
It delivers **Gong-level (and beyond) reasoning at a fraction of the cost**, while guaranteeing that **data never leaves Canada**.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Build a **Platform-Agnostic Sovereign Agentic OS** for Canadian professionals, starting with the **GoHighLevel (GHL)** ecosystem.

SYSTEM Launchpad sits between:
- ❌ Expensive, legacy enterprise tools (Gong)
- ❌ Low-intelligence transcription tools (Fireflies)

…and captures the gap with **true generative reasoning**, deep automation, and strict data sovereignty.

---

## 🧠 Core Value Proposition: The 6-TOOL Loop

SYSTEM Launchpad converts unstructured conversation into autonomous action.

| # | Tool | Function |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | **MeetingMind** | Record, transcribe, and diarize meetings |
| 2 | **ClientPulse** | Sentiment analysis and client health scoring |
| 3 | **ActionExtractor** | Extract tasks, owners, and deadlines |
| 4 | **RevenueRadar** | Detect financial signals and forecast revenue |
| 5 | **IntelligenceHub** | Cross-meeting pattern recognition |
| 6 | **PlaybookEngine** | Automate post-meeting workflows (GHL, email, CRM) |

This enables **“Vibe Operating”**: users delegate analysis and operations to intelligent agents, not rigid automations.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Sovereign AI Stack

| Component | Technology | Location |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 | Canada Central |
| Database & Auth | Supabase (Postgres, RLS) | Canada Central |
| Reasoning (MVP) | GPT-OSS-20B | ISAIC, Edmonton |
| Reasoning (Advanced) | GPT-OSS-120B | ISAIC, Edmonton |
| Transcription | Voxtral Mini 3B | ISAIC |
| Vector Memory | Qdrant | ISAIC |
| Automation | n8n | ISAIC |

> ⚠️ All Chinese-origin models are **explicitly excluded** by design.

---

## 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

SYSTEM Launchpad uses **MCP servers** to connect reasoning models to tools **without data leakage**.

- **Qdrant MCP** – semantic memory and cross-meeting intelligence  
- **PostgreSQL MCP** – schema-aware structured reasoning  
- **n8n MCP** – dynamic workflow execution  
- **MindsDB MCP (Phase 3)** – predictive intelligence  

---

## 🧩 Production-Grade RAG Architecture

### Hybrid Retrieval
- Vector search (Qdrant)
- Keyword search (PostgreSQL BM25)
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- GPT-OSS cross-encoder reranking

> Improves recall accuracy by **1–9%** vs vector-only RAG.

### Dual Pipeline
- **Offline**: ingestion, chunking, embedding, indexing  
- **Online**: retrieval, reranking, reasoning, response

### Semantic Caching
- Up to **68.8% LLM cost reduction**
- Sub-100ms responses for repeated queries
